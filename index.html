        <h3>About:</h3>
        Hello! Welcome to my webpage!
        <p>I'm a dynamic professional with a diverse background in Quality Assurance,
            Customer Support, and Data Analytics. I thrive on the challenges of troubleshooting and finding the root
            cause of issues,
            ensuring high-quality software and delivering the best possible experience to customers.
            Currently studying web development to pursue a career as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)
            or a Front-End Developer, I am constantly seeking ways to enhance my skills. <br>
            Outside of my professional interests, you'll find me indulging in my hobbies, such as hiking, practicing
            Pilates,
            tending on my small flower garden in hot Texas, and cooking up healthy meals.
